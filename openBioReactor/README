*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
The files in 'Bioreactor' are only compatible with "Arduino-1.0-RC1 IDE".


*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

The additional libraries have to be added into the ../libraries/ directory 
of the Arduino IDE. They should be compatible with the both versions, but have
only be tested and are modified to be compatible with the Arduino-1.0-RC1 IDE.

These libraries are the same that can be found on arduino.cc, but the
includes had to be slightly modified in order to be compatible with the new
Arduino IDE.
