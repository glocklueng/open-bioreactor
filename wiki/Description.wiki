A cost effective bioreactor that can be monitored and controlled by a web interface using Arduino board

= Introduction =

This project aims at using an Arduino board to monitor and control a bioreactor from a web interface. A first prototype was build at the Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia as an attempt to produce a cost effective and easily maintainable alternative to usually very expensive genuine bioreactors. The setup encompasses a home made bioreactor, an Arduino Mega 2560 board for control and monitoring, an embedded Alix computer as a server and a router. 

The features of the reactors are as follows:

  * pH monitoring
  * pH control using pinch valves (to be added soon)
  * NH4+ monitoring (to be added soon)
  * temperature monitoring and regulation (3 point measurement and heating regulation)
  * regulation of the motor used for agitation
  * liquid level monitoring
  * semi-batch operation using two peristaltic pumps
  * gas inlet control for 3 different gases.
